Given a matrix that is filled with ‘O’, ‘G’, and ‘W’ where ‘O’ represents open space, ‘G’ represents guards and ‘W’ represents walls in a Bank.
Replace all of the O’s in the matrix with their shortest distance from a guard, without being able to go through any walls.
Also, replace the guards with 0 and walls with -1 in output matrix.
Expected Time complexity is O(MN) for a M x N matrix.
